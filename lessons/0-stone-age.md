### Welcome to the Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp ðŸŽ‰

**Sponsored by Dugsiiye Online Courses** â€¢ Led by **Omar Tood & Mr Sharafdin**
**Kickoff: Mon, Sept 1 â€“ Duration: 1 Month**

This Bootcamp is designed in a **systematic, practice-first way**. From **Day 1** we start working, because the best way to learn ML is to follow the **workflow step by step**:

1. Collect Data
2. Preprocess Data
3. Split into Train/Test
4. Choose Model
5. Train Model
6. Evaluate Model
7. Deploy Model

ðŸ‘‰ **Week 1**: After short general theories, we immediately practice the first four steps â€” Collecting Data, Preprocessing, Splitting, and Choosing Models.
ðŸ‘‰ **Weeks 2â€“4**: Each week focuses on one sector â€” **Regression, Classification, and Clustering**. Every sector ends with a hands-on project that you can demo and explain.
ðŸ‘‰ **Final Stage**: Deployment â€” turning your model into a real application.

---

âœ¨ **Our goal is simple:** In just **one month**, move **from unreal to real, from unimaginable to imaginable** â€” by practicing the entire ML journey, one step at a time.
