# 🎓 **Certificate Verification System — Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp**

Welcome to the official **certificate verification system** for graduates of the
**Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp** by **ToodMind**.

This folder serves as a **public registry of issued certificates**, allowing anyone to verify the authenticity and project record of ToodMind Bootcamp graduates.

---

## 🧭 **Purpose**

The goal of this system is to provide a **transparent and trusted verification method** for all certificates issued by **ToodMind**.

Each certificate includes a unique **ID** recorded in an official JSON file — [`index.json`](./index.json).
If the ID appears in this file and is marked as **valid**, the certificate is confirmed as genuine.

## 📁 **Folder Structure**

```

├── index.json                      # Official list of issued certificates
├── certificate_farah_mohamed.pdf   # Example certificate PDF

└── README.md                       # This documentation file
```

## 📜 **How It Works**

1. Every graduate receives a **PDF certificate** with a unique ID (e.g., `DSML2025-01`).
2. That ID and relevant details are published in [`index.json`](./index.json).
3. Anyone can check the file to confirm whether a certificate is valid.
4. Each entry also includes a `project_link` so that the graduate’s final project can be reviewed.

If the record exists and `"status": "valid"`, the certificate is **officially verified by ToodMind**.

## 🔎 **How to Verify a Certificate**

1. Open the [`index.json`](./index.json) file.
2. Find the **certificate ID** shown on the PDF (e.g., `DSML2025-01`).
