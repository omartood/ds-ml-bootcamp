## ðŸ“‹ Assignment Questions  

Write your work in **English** using a clear academic style (headings, paragraphs, and references).
Length: **2â€“3 pages**. Use **your own words** â€” no copy-paste.

---

### **1. Introduction to Classification**

* What is **classification** in Machine Learning?
* How is it **different from regression**?
* Give **one real-life example** of classification and one of regression.

---

### **2A. Classification Algorithms**

* Describe the following algorithms:

  * **Logistic Regression**
  * **Decision Trees**
  * **Random Forest**
* For each algorithm, explain:

  * How it works (basic idea)
  * One real-world use case
  * Main advantages and limitations

---

### **2B. Extended Task â€“ Research Another Algorithm**

Choose **one other classification algorithm** that is **not** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest (examples: **Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Neural Networks**).

Write a short section about it:

* What problem is this algorithm good at solving?
* How does it work (the core idea)?
* One real-world application where it is used.
* What are its strengths and weaknesses compared to the algorithms in Section 2?

---

### **3. Classification Metrics**

* Define and explain what each of these metrics measures:

  * **Accuracy**
  * **Precision**
  * **Recall**
  * **F1-Score**
  * **Confusion Matrix**
* Add a **comparison table** showing their differences (when to use, what they focus on, weaknesses).

---

### **4. Imbalanced Data Problem**

* Explain what **imbalanced data** means in classification tasks.
* Why can accuracy be misleading in imbalanced datasets?
* Which metrics are more reliable in such cases, and why?

---

### **5. Real-World Case Study**

* Research a **real-world project or study** that used classification (e.g., spam detection, fraud detection, medical diagnosis, customer churn prediction).
* Summarize:

  * The goal of the project
  * The data they used
  * The classification model applied
  * The key results or insights
