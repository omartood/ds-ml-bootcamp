üéì Final Project ‚Äì ML Model Development & Deployment

Due: Friday, October 10, 2025 ‚Äî 12:00 PM (Africa/Mogadishu / EAT)

---

Part A ‚Äì Practical Project

Objective:
In this part, you will build a complete ML project of your own choice ‚Äî from dataset preparation, to training at least two algorithms, to deploying the final model with an API.

---

Instructions

1. Project Setup

Create a GitHub repository for your project.

Organize code into logical folders (dataset/, src/, api/, etc.).

2. Dataset

Use a dataset with at least 1,000 samples.

Document where you got the dataset (Kaggle, UCI, OpenML, self-collected, etc.).

3. Algorithms

Train at least two different algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression & Random Forest, or KMeans & DBSCAN, etc.).

Compare their performance using relevant metrics.

4. Model Evaluation

Show results with metrics and at least 3 sanity checks (sample predictions).

5. Deployment

Expose your trained model as an API (Flask or FastAPI).

Endpoint: /predict must accept JSON input and return predictions.

(Optional, but extra credit): add a simple frontend.

6. Documentation

Write a README.md inside your GitHub repo including:

Project title and description

Dataset details

Algorithms used

Example commands (python train.py, python app.py)

Example API usage with curl

Results summary

7. Paper/Report

Include a project_paper.md or project_paper.pdf in your repo.

Length: 3‚Äì5 pages.

Sections must include:

Problem statement & motivation

Dataset & preprocessing

Algorithms and why you chose them

Results & discussion

Deployment notes (API, frontend if included)

Lessons learned

---

Expected Output

A working GitHub repo with:

Training + inference code

Deployed API code

README with instructions

Project paper (Markdown or PDF)


API must run locally and respond correctly to /predict.

---

Part B ‚Äì Reflection Paper (Inside Repo)

Write a 3‚Äì5 page paper covering:

1. Introduction ‚Äì The problem you solved, why it matters.


2. Dataset ‚Äì Size, source, features, preprocessing steps.


3. Models ‚Äì Two algorithms you used, how they work.


4. Results ‚Äì Metrics + sanity checks. Which performed better?


5. Deployment ‚Äì How your API works. Example request & response.


6. Lessons Learned ‚Äì Challenges faced, what you improved, key takeaways.

---

üì§ Submission Format

In the submission portal, create a folder with your own name ‚Üí final_project/.

Inside it, submit a README.md file containing:

Project title

Short description (2‚Äì3 sentences)

Link to your GitHub repository

üëâ The full project (code + paper) must be inside the GitHub repo.

---

‚úÖ Evaluation Criteria

Problem choice & definition

Data cleaning & preprocessing

Correct use of at least 2 algorithms

Model evaluation & comparisons

Working API deployment

Documentation (README + paper)

Code quality & commit messages

---

‚úçÔ∏è Explanation:
This assignment is designed as your capstone/defense project.
Instead of being given a dataset and code, you choose the problem, dataset, and approach. The goal is to test your ability to:

Define a real ML problem

Collect & process data

Train & compare algorithms

Deploy a working API

Document your work professionally

By October 10, you will submit only a README.md file with repo link in the portal. The repo itself must contain all project files, code, and paper.
