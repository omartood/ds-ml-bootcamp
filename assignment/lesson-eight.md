## 📋 Assignment Questions

Write your work in **English** using a clear academic style (headings, paragraphs, and references).
Length: **2–3 pages**. Use **your own words** — no copy-paste.

---

### **1. Introduction to Clustering**

* What is **clustering** in Machine Learning?
* How is it **different from supervised learning** (regression/classification)?
* Give **one real-life example** of clustering and one of supervised learning.

---

### **2. Clustering Algorithms**

* Describe the following algorithms:

  * **K-Means**
  * **Hierarchical Clustering**
  * **DBSCAN**

* For each algorithm, explain:

  * How it works (basic idea)
  * One real-world use case
  * Main advantages and limitations

---

### **3. Clustering Metrics**

* Define and explain what each of these metrics measures:

  * **Elbow Method**
  * **Silhouette Score**
  * **Davies–Bouldin Index**

* Add a **comparison table** showing:

  * What each metric measures
  * What a “good” value means
  * When the metric is most useful

---

### **4. Challenges in Clustering**

* Why is clustering considered harder than supervised learning?
* Explain at least **two common challenges** in clustering, such as:

  * Choosing the right number of clusters (`k`).
  * Handling noise and outliers.
  * Dealing with high-dimensional data.

---

### **5. Real-World Case Study**

* Research a **real-world project or study** that used clustering (e.g., customer segmentation, image segmentation, genetics, social networks).
* Summarize:

  * The goal of the project
  * The data they used
  * The clustering model applied
  * The key results or insights
