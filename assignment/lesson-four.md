# ðŸ“˜ Lesson 4 â€” Regression

**Theory Assignment + Jupyter Setup Task**

**Due:** **Sunday, September 14, 2025 â€” 12:00 PM (Africa/Mogadishu / EAT)**

**Goal:** Understand the key concepts, types, and evaluation metrics of **Regression** in Machine Learning â€” and successfully set up **Jupyter Notebook** using Anaconda.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Part A â€” Theory Questions

Write your work in **English** using a clear academic style (headings, paragraphs, and references).
Length: **2â€“3 pages**. Use **your own words** â€” no copy-paste.

---

### **1. Introduction to Regression**

* What is **regression** in Machine Learning?
* How is it **different from classification**?
* Give **one real-life example** of regression and one of classification.

---

### **2. Types of Regression**

* Describe and compare the following types:

  * **Linear Regression**
  * **Multiple Linear Regression**
  * **Polynomial Regression**
* For each type, explain:

  * How it works (basic idea)
  * One real-world use case
  * Main advantages and limitations

---

### **3. Regression Metrics**

* Define and explain what each of these metrics measures:

  * **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
  * **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**
  * **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
  * **RÂ² (Coefficient of Determination)**
* Add a **comparison table** showing their differences (units, sensitivity to large errors, meaning).

---

### **4. Underfitting and Overfitting**

* Explain what **underfitting** and **overfitting** mean in regression models.
* What **causes overfitting**, especially in polynomial regression?
* Give **2â€“3 methods to prevent overfitting**.

---

### **5. Real-World Case Study**

* Research a **real-world project or study** that used **regression** (linear, multiple, or polynomial) in any field such as business, healthcare, education, or transportation.
* Summarize:

  * The goal of the project
  * The data they used
  * The type of regression model applied
  * The key results or insights

## ðŸ’» Part B â€” Practical Jupyter Setup Task

**Goal:** Ensure everyone has Jupyter Notebook ready for coding in future lessons.

**Instructions:**

1. Install **Anaconda** on your computer.

2. Open **Jupyter Notebook** from the Anaconda Navigator.

3. Create a new **Python notebook**.

4. In the first cell, write this code:

   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```

5. Run the cell and check that it prints:

   ```
   Hello, World!
   ```

## ðŸ“¤ What to Submit

Submit these **two files**:

* **Part A:** Your written assignment as `paper.md` (recommended) or `.pdf` / `.docx`.
* **Part B:** Your Jupyter Notebook file `hello_world.ipynb`.
