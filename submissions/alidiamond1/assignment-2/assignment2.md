# Research Paper: Sales and Marketing Analysis for Home Goods

## Title & Collection Method

**Title:** Sales and Marketing Analysis Dataset
**Collection Method:** This dataset was synthetically generated by simulating the sales and marketing patterns of a fictional home goods company. I recorded sales transactions, marketing campaign types, costs, and revenue to create a realistic dataset suitable for a machine learning project. The data is hypothetical but designed to mimic real-world business scenarios.

## Description of Features & Labels

*   **Features (X) - Input Variables:**

    1.  **Product** (Categorical: Mattress, Pillow, Bed, Cabinet)
    2.  **Region** (Categorical: Mogadishu, Hargeisa, etc.)
    3.  **Sales_Channel** (Categorical: Distributor, Online, Shop)
    4.  **Marketing_Campaign** (Categorical: Social Media, TV Ad, Radio, Billboard)
    5.  **Units_Sold** (Numeric)
    6.  **Unit_Price_USD** (Numeric)
    7.  **Revenue_USD** (Numeric)
    8.  **Marketing_Spend_USD** (Numeric)

*   **Label (y) - Output Variable:**

    *   **Return_on_Investment_ROI** (Numeric)

This makes the problem a **Regression Task** (predicting a continuous numerical value).

## Data Quality Issues

*   **Missing Values:** Several records are missing data in the `Marketing_Campaign` column, which will need to be handled during preprocessing.
*   **Categorical Text:** Columns like `Product`, `Region`, `Sales_Channel`, and `Marketing_Campaign` must be encoded into numerical values to be used in machine learning models.
*   **Feature Dependency:** The `Revenue_USD` column can be calculated directly from `Units_Sold` and `Unit_Price_USD`. This is an important consideration during feature selection and model building.

## Use Case

This dataset can be used to train a **Regression Model** to predict the **Return on Investment (ROI)** of a marketing campaign.

*   **Possible Algorithms:** Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest.
*   **Potential Benefit:** The model could help the company identify which types of campaigns, regions, and products are most profitable. This allows for better allocation of the marketing budget to maximize overall return.
