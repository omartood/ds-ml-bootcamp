# Planning Student Major: ML-Based Faculty Recommendation System

## Short Description
This project uses machine learning to recommend suitable university faculties to graduating high school students based on their academic performance, extracurricular activities, and personal background. The deployed system uses the XGBoost model to provide fast and reliable predictions through a web application.

## Deployment
The web application is live at: [https://student-major-al.vercel.app/](https://student-major-al.vercel.app/)  
> **Note:** Only the XGBoost model is deployed due to size constraints. Other models (Random Forest and Stacking Ensemble) are larger (300–400 MB) and are available in the GitHub repository for offline use.
