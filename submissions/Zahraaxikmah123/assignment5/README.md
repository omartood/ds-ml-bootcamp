# Assignment Five: House Price Prediction

This folder contains my submission for **Assignment Five: House Price Prediction**. The assignment focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to predict house prices using a cleaned dataset.

## Contents

- **house_price_prediction.ipynb**  
  This Jupyter Notebook includes all the code for data preparation, model training (Linear Regression & Random Forest), evaluation, and single-row sanity checks. All results and outputs are clearly shown in the notebook.

- **reflection_paper.md**  
  This markdown file contains my written reflection on the assignment. It covers what I implemented, a comparison of the two models, an explanation of Random Forest, discussion of evaluation metrics, and my overall findings and model preference.

## Summary

In this assignment, I learned how to:
- Prepare data for machine learning.
- Train and compare Linear Regression and Random Forest models.
- Evaluate model performance using standard regression metrics.
- Reflect on the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.

Both files together demonstrate my understanding of house price prediction using machine learning in Python.
