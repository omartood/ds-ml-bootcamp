# Clustering in Machine Learning – Paper

This folder contains my assignment eight paper **"Clustering in Machine Learning: Concepts, Algorithms, Metrics, Challenges, and a Case Study"**.

## Overview

- Explains what clustering is and how it differs from supervised learning.
- Describes key clustering algorithms: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN.
- Discusses evaluation metrics: Elbow Method, Silhouette Score, and Davies–Bouldin Index.
- Highlights common challenges in clustering.
- Includes a real-world case study on clustering for music recommendation systems.

## How to Use

- Read `clustering_paper.md` for a clear, structured overview of clustering concepts, algorithms, metrics, and practical applications.
