# Assignment 10: Model Deployment

## 🎯 Objective
This assignment demonstrates my ability to deploy a machine learning model for house price prediction using Flask (backend) and Next.js/Bun (frontend). The full project is available on my GitHub repository for review and testing.

## 🚀 What I Did
- Trained regression models (Linear Regression & Random Forest) on a cleaned house dataset
- Engineered features and built a scalable prediction pipeline
- Developed a REST API using Flask for serving predictions
- Created a modern frontend client with Next.js/Bun for user interaction
- Integrated backend and frontend for real-time predictions
- Added all necessary files: code, models, datasets, requirements, and documentation
- Pushed the complete project to GitHub with clear, structured commits

## 📦 Deployment & Access
- The project is fully deployed to GitHub and ready for review
- All code, data, and instructions are included for easy reproduction
- API and client can be run locally following the README instructions

## 🔗 GitHub Repository

## 📝 Notes
- I followed best practices for code organization and commit history
- Each commit is meaningful and describes the changes made
- The deployment includes both backend and frontend, as well as the trained models and datasets
- The project README contains setup instructions, API usage, and license information

## ✅ Review
Engineer, waxaad si toos ah uga heli kartaa dhammaan files-ka iyo deployment-ka repo-kan kor ku xusan. Haddii aad wax su'aal ah ka qabto ama aad rabto faahfaahin dheeraad ah, waa diyaar.
