# Premier League Match Prediction System

This project builds a **machine learning-based prediction system** to forecast the outcomes of English Premier League matches. The system predicts whether a match will end in a **Home Win**, **Draw**, or **Away Win**, using historical match data and team performance indicators.

## Algorithms Used

To achieve accurate predictions, three machine learning algorithms were implemented:

1. **Logistic Regression** ‚Äì calculates the probabilities for each possible match outcome.
2. **Random Forest Classifier** ‚Äì ensemble of decision trees that combines multiple predictions to improve accuracy.
3. **XGBoost** ‚Äì modern gradient boosting algorithm for enhanced predictive performance.

## System Architecture

- **Backend (Flask API):** Handles input data and serves predictions from the trained ML models.
- **Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS):** Provides a responsive interface for users to enter match data and view prediction results in real time.

## Features

- Real-time match prediction through a user-friendly web interface.
- Integration of machine learning models with a backend API.
- Use of multiple ML algorithms to improve accuracy and reliability.
