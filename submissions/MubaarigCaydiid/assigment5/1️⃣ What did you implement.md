1️⃣ What did you implement?



* I implemented a machine learning model to predict house prices.



* I used Linear Regression (LR), which simply predicts values using a straight line.



* I also used Random Forest (RF), which is an ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to produce more accurate predictions.



2️⃣ How you trained Linear Regression and Random Forest?



* I trained the models by first splitting the dataset into X (features) and y (target), and then further splitting it into 80% training and 20% testing sets.



* Linear Regression: I trained the model on the training set, tested it on the test set, and evaluated metrics such as R², MAE, MSE, and RMSE.



* Random Forest: I trained the model using multiple decision trees and tested it on the test set.



3️⃣ Comparison of Models



* Sanity Check Predictions: The predictions differed between the models.



1. LR: Its predictions were acceptable but not always accurate.



2\.    RF: Its predictions were very close to the actual values and appeared more realistic compared to Linear Regression.



4️⃣ Understanding Random Forest



Random Forest (RF): It is an ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to improve accuracy.



How it works: Each tree in the forest makes a prediction, and the predictions are averaged (for regression) to produce the final result.



5️⃣ Metrics Discussion



* Random Forest: Higher R² and lower MAE and RMSE → more accurate predictions.



* Linear Regression: Lower R² → less accurate predictions, higher error.



* RF Strengths: Provides accurate predictions, robust to outliers, handles non-linear datasets well.



* RF Weaknesses: Requires more memory and longer training time.



* LR Strengths: Simple to train, easy to interpret.



LR Weaknesses: Less accurate when data is non-linear, higher prediction error.
