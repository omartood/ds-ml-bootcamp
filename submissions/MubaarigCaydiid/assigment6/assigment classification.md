# 1. What is Classification?
- Classification is a type of supervised machine learning that predicts categories, such as spam or not, yes or no, male or female, etc.
- Difference between classification and regression:
  - Regression predicts numeric values.
  - Real-life regression examples: predicting car prices, house prices, or game scores between two teams.
  - Real-life classification examples: predicting if an email is spam or not, or whether a person is male or female, or whether someone is sick or healthy.

# 2A. Classification Algorithms

## 1. Logistic Regression
- A classification algorithm.
- Uses a sigmoid function to map outputs between 0 and 1.
- Advantages: works well when data is linearly separable.
- Weakness: cannot handle non-linear relationships as effectively as neural networks.

## 2. Decision Trees
- Uses conditions (if/else, yes/no) to make decisions.
- Real-world use case: Credit scoring â€“ banks use it to determine if a person qualifies for a loan based on past repayment history.
- Advantages:
  - Easy to understand and interpret.
  - Can handle both categorical and numerical data.
- Weakness:
  - Can overfit with large datasets, but removing outliers improves performance.

## 3. Random Forest
- An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees.
- Better performance than a single decision tree.
- Real-world use case: predicting whether a person has a disease or is healthy.
- Advantages:
  - Reduces overfitting compared to decision trees.
  - Can be used for both regression and classification.
  - Multiple trees improve prediction accuracy.
- Weakness: slower due to multiple trees.

# 2B. Neural Networks
- Good for solving complex problems like facial and voice recognition, which are difficult for other algorithms.
- Real-world use: Face recognition on mobile phones.
- Advantages: very powerful; excels in pattern recognition tasks like face and voice identification.
- Weakness: requires large datasets and high computational power; harder to predict compared to simpler algorithms.

# 3. Classification Metrics
- **Accuracy**: measures the ratio of correct predictions to total predictions; can be misleading in imbalanced datasets.
- **Precision**: measures correct positive predictions only; reduces false positives.
- **Recall**: measures how many actual positives are captured; avoids missing true positives.
- **F1-Score**: the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced metric.

# 4. Imbalanced Data Problem
- Occurs when some classes dominate the dataset.
- High accuracy may be misleading because the model focuses on the majority class.

# 5. Real-World Prediction Example
- Goal: identify people with cancer.
- Data: age, gender, symptoms, test results.
- Models used: Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks.
- Insights: accurately identifies people with and without the disease.
- Helps doctors specialized in diagnosing this condition.
