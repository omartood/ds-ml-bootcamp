1\. Define Machine Learning using real-life example ?

Machine learning is the process of optimizing the model so that it can
predict the correct response based on the training data samples

Machine learning is the subset of artificial intelligence (AI) focused
on algorithms that can “learn” the patterns of training data and,
subsequently, make

accurate *inferences* about new data

<img src="./anfmqxwr.png" style="width:6.5in;height:4.19583in" />This
pattern recognition ability enables machine learning models to make
decisions or predictions without explicit, hard-coded instructions

Machine learning works by training algorithms on sets of data to achieve
an expected outcome such as identifying a pattern or recognizing an
object.

2\. Compare Supervised Learning and Un Supervised Learning give me
example of each ?

Supervised Learning: it is like a teacher or supervisor guiding the
machine, In this approach we teach or train the machine using the
labelled data(correct answers or classifications) which means each input
has the correct output in the form of answer or category attached to it,
After that machine is provided with a new set of examples (data) so that
it can analyses the training data and produces a correct outcome from
labeled data.

**example**, a labeled dataset of images of Elephant, Camel and Cow
would have each image tagged with either "Maroodi, "Geel" or "Sac."

Types of Supervised Learning

1\. Regression

A regression is used to predict continuous values such as stock prices
or temperature, house prices Regression algorithms learn how to connect
input data to a specific number or value

Some common regression algorithms:

> 1\. Linear Regression
>
> 2\. Polynomial Regression 3. Lasso Regression
>
> 4\. Ridge Regression

2\. Classification

A classification is used to predict categorical values such as whether a
customer will buy or not, whether an email is spam or not or whether a
medical image shows a tumor or not

Some of the most common classification algorithms:

> 1\. Logistic Regression
>
> 2\. Support Vector Machines 3. Decision Trees
>
> 4\. Random Forests 5. Naive Baye

<img src="./aldtbtof.png"
style="width:6.48889in;height:2.14444in" />Un Supervised Learning: In
this approach the machine is given with data that has no labels or
categories, It analyzes the data on its own to find patterns, groups or
relationships without any prior knowledge, Example, unsupervised
learning can analyze animal data and group the animals by their traits
and behavior

Types of Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is divided into two categories of algorithms:

1\. Clustering

A clustering is used to group similar data points together, Clustering
algorithms work by repeatedly moving data points closer to to the center
of their group (cluster) and farther from points in other groups. This
helps the algorithm to create clear and meaningful clusters.

Some popular clustering algorithms:

> 1\. K-means clustering
>
> 2\. Hierarchical clustering
>
> 3\. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

2\. Association rule learning

An association rule learning used to find patterns and relationships
between different items in a dataset It looks for rules like “people who
buy X often also buy Y”

Some common Association rule learning algorithms:

> 1\. Apriori Algorithm 2. Eclat Algorithm
>
> 3\. FP-Growth Algorithm

3\. what causes overfitting? How can it prevented?

Overfitting is an undesirable machine learning behavior that occurs when
the machine learning model gives accurate predictions for training data
but not for new data When data scientists use machine learning models
for making predictions, they first train the model on a known data set.
Then, based on this information, the model tries to predict outcomes for
new data sets. An overfit model can give inaccurate predictions and
cannot perform well for all types of new data.

> <img src="./cozv34m5.png"
> style="width:2.87361in;height:1.92083in" />It’s prevented
>
> 1: Early stopping: Stops training before the model starts learning
> noise, preventing overfitting
>
> 2: Pruning (Feature selection): Keeps only the most important features
> and removes irrelevant ones
>
> 3: Regularization: Adds penalties to less useful features to reduce
> overfitting.

4: Ensembling: Combines results from multiple models (bagging =
parallel, boosting = sequential) for better accuracy

5: Data augmentation: Slightly alters training data (e.g., flipping,
rotating images) to create variety and prevent overfitting

overfitting causes the model to predict very poorly on new data points.

4\. Explain how training data and test data are split, and why this
process is necessary?

Splitting datasets in this manner aims to ensure that the model not only
focuses on learning from a specific data set but also performs well when
faced with new and unseen data. This is a critical strategy for ensuring
that the model provides more general and consistent results.

Proper management of datasets is key to the success of machine learning
models in real-world applications, and therefore, every step of this
process must be carefully planned.

>
> • Validation Set • Test Set
>
> • Data Splitting Ratio
