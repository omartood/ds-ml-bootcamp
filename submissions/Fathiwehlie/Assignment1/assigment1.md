 #Assignment #1 

## Machine Learning using a real-life example. 

Machine Learning is a method of teaching computers to recognize patterns and make decisions based on data, without being given fixed instructions. 

For example, Google Translate uses Machine Learning to study billions of previously translated texts, learning how words and phrases are used in different contexts. Instead of memorizing each word like a dictionary, it understands sentence structures and meanings, allowing it to predict accurate translations for new sentences.  

## Compare Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning, giving an example of each. 

| Feature     | Supervised Learning  | Unsupervised Learning    |
|-------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Data Type    | Labeled data (known outputs)  | Unlabeled data (no outputs)       |
| Goal      | Predict outputs for new data   | Find patterns or groupings in data        |
| Guidance  | Yes (training with known results)   | No (model finds structure on its own)    |
| Examples  | Medical Diagnosis    | Document Clustering     |


### Supervised Learning (example):
 Medical Diagnosis – Predict disease outcomes based on labeled patient data. 

### Unsupervised Learning (example):
 Document Clustering – News articles are automatically grouped into topics based on their content, without predefined labels. 

## What causes Overfitting? How can it be prevented 

Overfitting happens when a model learns the training data too well, including noise, and fails to generalize to new data. It can be prevented by using more data, simplifying the model, applying regularization, performing cross-validation, and selecting relevant features. 

## Explain how training data and test data are split, and why this process is necessary 

Training data is used to teach the model patterns, while test data evaluates its performance on unseen data.  

This split is necessary to ensure the model generalizes well, avoids overfitting, and accurately measures real-world performance. 

## Case study (Transportation) 

Machine Learning drives modern transportation by analyzing traffic, optimizing routes, and enabling autonomous vehicles. Google Maps uses ML to suggest the fastest routes, estimate arrival times, and recommend nearby places. Ride-sharing apps like Uber and Lyft match drivers and riders, set dynamic prices, and adjust routes using real-time traffic data.
