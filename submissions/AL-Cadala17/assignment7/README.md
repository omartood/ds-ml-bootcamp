# ‚úçÔ∏è Assignment 7: Spam Detection Models

## 1. üìã Overview
This project focuses on the practical application of **machine learning models** for text classification and spam detection. The main objective was to train, evaluate, and compare the performance of three distinct classification models: **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest Classifier**, and **Multinomial Naive Bayes**, to determine the most effective approach for filtering unsolicited messages.

## 2. üéØ Key Objectives
The following key objectives were successfully completed in this assignment:

**Data Preparation**: The dataset was loaded, preprocessed (encoding labels), and split into training and testing sets.

**Feature Extraction**: Text messages were converted into numerical features using **TF-IDF Vectorization**.

**Model Building**: **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest Classifier**, and **Multinomial Naive Bayes** models were built and trained on the TF-IDF features.

**Performance Evaluation**: The models were evaluated using the required classification metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix) and single-message sanity checks.

**Model Comparison**: The performance and prediction behavior of the three models were analyzed to draw a conclusion about the best model for real-world spam filtering.
