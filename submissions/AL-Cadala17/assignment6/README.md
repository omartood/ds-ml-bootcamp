## üéØ Key Objectives

This assignment was divided into five main sections, each addressing a critical component of classification:

### 1. Introduction to Classification
* Explained what classification is and how it differs from regression.
* Provided clear, real-life examples for both classification and regression.

### 2. Classification Algorithms
* Detailed the workings, advantages, and limitations of four key algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
* Provided a real-world use case for each algorithm to illustrate its application.

### 3. Evaluating Classification Models
* Defined and explained the use of key performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and the Confusion Matrix.
* Included a comparison table to summarize the strengths and weaknesses of each metric.

### 4. The Imbalanced Data Problem
* Addressed the issue of imbalanced data and why accuracy can be a misleading metric in such cases.
* Emphasized the importance of Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for imbalanced datasets.

### 5. Real-World Case Study: Credit Card Fraud Detection
* Summarized a hypothetical case study to demonstrate how classification is used in a real-world scenario.
* Highlighted the practical application of key metrics like Precision and Recall.
