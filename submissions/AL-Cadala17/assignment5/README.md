# ‚úçÔ∏è Assignment 5: House Price Prediction Models
---
## 1. üìã Overview
This project focuses on the practical application of **machine learning models** for house price prediction. The main objective was to train, evaluate, and compare the performance of two distinct regression models: **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor**, to determine which one provides a more reliable prediction.

## 2. üéØ Key Objectives
The following key objectives were successfully completed in this assignment:

* **Data Preparation**: The dataset was loaded, and features (x) and the target variable (y) were separated and split into training and testing sets.
* **Model Building**: Both a **Linear Regression** model and a **Random Forest Regressor** were built and trained on the dataset.
* **Performance Evaluation**: The models were evaluated using various metrics ($R^2$, MAE, MSE, RMSE) and a single-row sanity check was performed.
* **Model Comparison**: The performance of the two models was analyzed, and a conclusion was drawn about which model is more suitable for this specific task.
