# ‚úçÔ∏è Assignment 9: Spending Pattern Analysis with K-Means

---

## 1. üìã Overview

This project focuses on the practical application of the **K-Means clustering algorithm** for customer segmentation. The main objective was to analyze a customer dataset and group individuals into distinct clusters based on their `Income_$` and `SpendingScore`. The goal is to identify meaningful customer personas that a business can use for targeted marketing strategies.

## 2. üéØ Key Objectives

The following key objectives were successfully completed in this assignment:

* **Data Preparation**: The dataset was loaded, and the `Income_$` and `SpendingScore` features were selected, preprocessed, and scaled using `StandardScaler`.
* **Optimal K Selection**: The **Elbow Method** was used to determine the best number of clusters (K) by calculating the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) for K values from 1 to 10.
* **Model Training**: A `KMeans` model was built and trained using the optimal K value of 4, and each customer in the dataset was assigned a cluster label.
* **Performance Evaluation**: The quality of the resulting clusters was evaluated using the **Silhouette Score** and the **Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI)**.
* **Analysis and Interpretation**: The cluster centers were analyzed to create distinct customer personas, and a sanity check was performed on random samples to validate the model's logic.
