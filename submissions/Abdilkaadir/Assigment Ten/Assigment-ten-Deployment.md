## Overview

This project explores housing datasets to build and deploy a predictive model.
It highlights the difference between using partially processed data versus fully cleaned data, showing how preprocessing steps can affect prediction accuracy.

## Datasets

* **house_l3_dataset.csv** → Level 3 dataset (raw or partially cleaned)
* **clean_house_l5_dataset.csv** → Level 5 dataset (fully cleaned, applied in final modeling)

## Objectives

* Carry out data preparation and preprocessing
* Train machine learning models
* Evaluate performance across different dataset qualities
* Deploy the finalized model for practical use

## Contribution

The project demonstrates the role of data quality in machine learning results and delivers a working solution for predicting housing prices.
