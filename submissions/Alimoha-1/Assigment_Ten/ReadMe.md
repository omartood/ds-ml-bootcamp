# Research README — Housing Data & Deployment

## Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing **housing datasets** and building a **predictive model** for deployment.  
It compares raw/semi-cleaned and fully cleaned datasets to demonstrate how preprocessing impacts prediction accuracy.

## Datasets  
- **`house_l3_dataset.csv`** → Level 3 dataset (raw / semi-cleaned)  
- **`clean_house_l5_dataset.csv`** → Level 5 dataset (fully cleaned, used for final modeling)  

## Goals  
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Train predictive models  
- Compare performance between datasets  
- Deploy the model for real-world use  

## Contribution  
The project shows how **data quality** directly influences ML performance and provides a deployable solution for housing price prediction.
