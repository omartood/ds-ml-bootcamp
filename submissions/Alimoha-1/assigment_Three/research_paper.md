#  Research Summary: Used Car Dataset Preprocessing

## 1. Introduction
Real-world datasets are often messy, with missing values, duplicates, outliers, and inconsistent formats. This research cleans and preprocesses a **used car dataset** to make it suitable for analysis and predictive modeling.

---

## 2. Objectives
- Handle missing and inconsistent values  
- Remove duplicates  
- Detect and treat outliers  
- Encode categorical variables  
- Scale numerical features  
- Create new useful features  

---

## 3. Methodology
1. **Inspection** – Checked structure, types, and missing values.  
2. **Cleaning** – Fixed price format, standardized locations, filled missing values, and removed duplicates.  
3. **Outliers** – Used IQR method to clip extreme values.  
4. **Encoding** – Converted categorical variables into numeric form.  
5. **Feature Engineering** – Added `CarAge`, `Is_City`, and `LogPrice`.  
6. **Scaling** – Standardized numerical features for balance.

## 4. Results
- Dataset cleaned and consistent  
- Outliers reduced  
- Missing values resolved  
- New features added  
- Data ready for machine learning

## 5. Conclusion
Preprocessing improved the dataset’s quality, ensuring **reliable analysis** and **better predictive performance** in car price modeling.
