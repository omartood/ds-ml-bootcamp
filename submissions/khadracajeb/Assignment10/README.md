# 🏠 House Price Prediction Deployment

This project demonstrates the deployment of a **machine learning model** to predict house prices.  
It includes both a **Flask backend API** for serving predictions and a **Next.js/Bun frontend** for interactive user experience.  
The deployment ensures that anyone can run the project locally and get real-time predictions.

## 🎯 Goal

The goal of this project is to provide a **fully functional house price prediction system** that is:  
- **Accurate**: Trained on cleaned house datasets using Linear Regression and Random Forest models.  
- **Scalable**: Features engineering and a pipeline that can handle new data efficiently.  
- **Interactive**: Users can enter house details on the frontend and get instant predictions from the backend.  
- **Complete**: Includes all necessary files — code, models and datasets — for easy setup and testing.
