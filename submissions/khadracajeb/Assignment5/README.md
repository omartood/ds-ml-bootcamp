# Assignment Five: House Price Prediction

## Summary

This assignment focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning models. I trained and evaluated **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest** models on a cleaned dataset to understand their performance in regression tasks.

## Files Included in this folder Assignment 5

- `house_price_prediction.ipynb`  
  Contains all code for data preparation, model training, evaluation, and single-row sanity checks. All outputs are clearly shown.

- `Reflection_Paper.md`  
  Includes a written reflection on the implementation, a comparison of the two models, an explanation of Random Forest, discussion of evaluation metrics, and findings.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this assignment, I learned to:

- Learned data preparation  
- Training and Test 
- Comparing Linear Regression & Random Forest  
- Evaluating with RÂ², MAE, MSE, RMSE  
- Understanding model strengths and weaknesses

## Alhamdulillah for understanding this lesson!
