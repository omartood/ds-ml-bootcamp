# Assignment — Classification
---

## 1. Introduction to Classification  

Classification in Machine Learning is the process of predicting categories or labels for given data. Instead of predicting a number, the model predicts which group an input belongs to. For example, a classifier may decide if an email is **spam** or **not spam**.  

## 2. The difference from regression 

The difference between classification and regression is that **regression predicts continuous values** (like house prices or temperatures), while **classification predicts discrete labels** (like yes/no, disease/no disease).  

## 3. Real Examples of classification and regression

*Example of classification:* A bank system classifies loan applications as *approved* or *rejected*.  
*Example of regression:* Predicting the price of a car based on mileage, brand, and age.

## 2A. Classification Algorithms  

### Logistic Regression  
**Logistic Regression:** Logistic Regression uses a mathematical function (sigmoid) to estimate probabilities of belonging to a class. If the probability is above 0.5, the model predicts one class; otherwise, it predicts the other.  

**Use case:** Detecting whether a customer will buy a product (yes/no).  

**Advantages:** Simple, fast, and easy to interpret.  

---

### Decision Trees  
**Decision Trees:** Decision Trees split data into smaller groups by asking a series of questions (nodes). Each path leads to a decision at the leaf node.  

**Use case:** Medical diagnosis, where the tree decides if a patient is healthy or sick based on symptoms.  

**Advantages:** Easy to visualize, handles categorical and numerical data.  

---

### Random Forest  
**Random Forest:** Random Forest is an ensemble method that builds many Decision Trees on random parts of the data and averages their results. This reduces overfitting.  

**Use case:** Credit card fraud detection.  

**Advantages:** High accuracy, handles large datasets, less overfitting than a single Decision Tree.

## 2B. Extended Task – Support Vector Machines (SVM)  

**Problem it solves:** SVM is good at solving problems where the classes are not easily separated. It tries to find the “best boundary” (hyperplane) that separates different classes.  

**How it works:** It draws a line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that maximizes the margin between different classes.  

**Real-world application:** Face recognition systems.  

**Strengths:** Works well for high-dimensional data, effective when classes are clearly separable.  
**Weaknesses:** Computationally expensive on large datasets, harder to tune than Logistic Regression or Decision Trees.

## Comparison of SVM with Other Algorithms  

### 1. SVM vs Logistic Regression  
- Both are used for binary classification.  
- Logistic Regression predicts probabilities using a linear boundary, while SVM finds the best margin (maximum separation line).  
- Logistic Regression is easier to interpret and faster on large datasets, but SVM usually performs better on complex, high-dimensional data.  

### 2. SVM vs Decision Trees  
- Decision Trees split data into rules, making them easy to understand and visualize.  
- SVM, on the other hand, is less interpretable but often more accurate when the data is not linearly separable.  
- Decision Trees may overfit easily, while SVM tries to generalize better with the margin concept.  

### 3. SVM vs Random Forest  
- Random Forest uses many Decision Trees and works very well on large and noisy datasets.  
- SVM works best when the dataset is smaller but with clear boundaries between classes.  
- Random Forest is more robust to outliers and noise, while SVM can be sensitive to noisy data.

| Algorithm           | Strengths                           | Weaknesses                     | When to Use |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|

| Decision Trees      | Easy to understand, flexible         | Overfitting risk                | When explainability matters |
| Random Forest       | High accuracy, handles large data    | Harder to interpret, slower     | Complex real-world tasks |
| SVM                 | Great for high-dimensional data, strong boundaries | Computationally heavy, less interpretable | Small/medium data with clear separation |

## 3. Classification Metrics  

- **Accuracy:** Measures how many predictions are correct overall. Best when data is balanced.  
- **Precision:** Out of all predicted positives, how many were truly positive. Important when false positives are costly.  
- **Recall:** Out of all actual positives, how many were correctly identified. Important when false negatives are costly (e.g., missing a cancer diagnosis).  
- **F1-Score:** The harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, balancing both.  
- **Confusion Matrix:** A table showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. It gives a full picture of performance.  

### Comparison Table  

| Metric          | Focus                        | Best Use Case | Weakness |
|-----------------|------------------------------|---------------|----------|
| Accuracy        | Overall correctness          | Balanced data | Misleading with imbalance |
| Precision       | Correct positive predictions | Spam filters (avoid false alarms) | Ignores false negatives |
| Recall          | Capturing all positives      | Medical tests (avoid missing cases) | Ignores false positives |
| F1-Score        | Balance between P & R        | When both matter | Harder to interpret |
| Confusion Matrix| Complete breakdown           | Any task      | Needs interpretation |

## 4. Imbalanced Data Problem  

Imbalanced data means that one class has many more examples than the other. For instance, in fraud detection, only 1% of transactions are fraudulent, while 99% are normal.  

Accuracy can be misleading here. A model predicting “no fraud” for all cases would be 99% accurate but completely useless.  

In such cases, **Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and the Confusion Matrix** are more reliable because they show how well the model detects the minority class, not just the majority.

## 5. Real-World Case Study  

**Case Study: Spam Detection**  

*Goal:* The aim was to classify emails as spam or not spam.  
*Data:* A dataset of thousands of emails with labeled categories (spam or ham).  
*Model:* A **Random Forest** classifier was applied.  
*Results:* The Random Forest model performed strongly, achieving high accuracy and balanced precision and recall. It was able to capture the complex patterns in text data that simple models might miss. The study showed that Random Forest is effective in spam detection because it reduces overfitting and gives robust predictions across different types of emails.
