## 📝 Project Summary 
This project is a complete Machine Learning solution for forecasting volatile food commodity prices in Somalia using the WFP dataset. It features three trained algorithms (Random Forest, GBR, and Linear Regression) deployed via a robust Flask API and integrated with a simple React frontend. The deployment is notable for its **Smart Input Default** system, which allows users to make predictions using  core features.
