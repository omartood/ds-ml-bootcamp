# 🏠 House Price Prediction Deployment

This project showcases how a machine learning model can be deployed to estimate house prices.  
It comes with a **Flask API backend** for generating predictions and a **Next.js/Bun frontend** for user interaction.  
With this setup, anyone can run the system locally and test predictions in real time.
