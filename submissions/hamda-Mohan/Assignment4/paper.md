## 1. Introduction to Regression

Regression is a method in machine learning that helps us predict a continuous outcome based on one or more input features (James et al., 2021). In simple terms, it tries to find patterns in data so we can estimate a number, like predicting a person’s electricity bill next month (Géron, 2019).  

The main difference between regression and classification is that regression predicts **numbers**, while classification predicts **categories** (James et al., 2021). For instance:  
- **Regression example:** Estimating the monthly rainfall in a city based on past weather patterns (Wongsapai et al., 2017).  
- **Classification example:** Deciding if an email is spam or not (Géron, 2019).  

Regression is very useful in real life because many problems involve numbers that change continuously, like prices, temperatures, or travel time (Kuhn & Johnson, 2019). Using regression allows us to make predictions that guide decisions and planning.

## 2. Types of Regression

### Linear Regression

Linear regression assumes a straight-line relationship between one feature and the target (James et al., 2021). It finds the best line that fits the data points.

- **Example:** Predicting a student’s final exam score based on their hours of study (Géron, 2019).  
- **Advantages:** Simple to understand and implement; easy to interpret.  
- **Limitations:** Can’t model complex or curved relationships (James et al., 2021).

### Multiple Linear Regression

This type uses two or more features to predict the target. It helps when multiple factors influence the outcome (Kuhn & Johnson, 2019).

- **Example:** Predicting a car’s price using age, mileage, brand, and engine size (Sharma & Gupta, 2020).  
- **Advantages:** Can include multiple factors at once for better predictions.  
- **Limitations:** If the features are highly correlated, it can confuse the model (multicollinearity) (Kuhn & Johnson, 2019).

### Polynomial Regression

Polynomial regression uses squared or higher-power terms to capture curved relationships between features and the target (Lee & Kim, 2019).

- **Example:** Modeling how a car’s fuel efficiency changes with speed (Lee & Kim, 2019).  
- **Advantages:** Good for non-linear patterns.  
- **Limitations:** Too high a degree can overfit the data and give poor predictions on new data (Rawat, 2022).

## 3. Regression Metrics

We need metrics to measure how good our regression model is (Géron, 2019):

- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error):** Average absolute difference between predicted and actual values. Easy to understand.  
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error):** Squares errors before averaging, so big mistakes count more.  
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error):** Square root of MSE; same unit as target, easier to interpret.  
- **R² (Coefficient of Determination):** How much of the variation in the target can be explained by the model (James et al., 2021).

**Comparison Table**

| Metric | Units | Sensitivity to Large Errors | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------------------------|---------|
| MAE    | Same as target | Low  | Average size of errors |
| MSE    | Squared units  | High | Penalizes large errors more |
| RMSE   | Same as target | High | Easy to interpret in same units |
| R²     | Unitless (0–1) | N/A  | Percentage of variance explained |

This table shows that depending on your goal, you might choose one metric over another. For example, if big errors are very bad, MSE or RMSE is better (Géron, 2019).

## 4. Underfitting and Overfitting

- **Underfitting:** When the model is too simple to capture the real pattern (Rawat, 2022). Example: Predicting sales using only the month, ignoring advertising or holidays.  
- **Overfitting:** When the model is too complex and learns both patterns and random noise (Rawat, 2022). High-degree polynomial regression often overfits.

**Causes of Overfitting:**  
- Very complex models  
- Small or noisy datasets  
- Using too many features  

**Ways to Prevent Overfitting:**  
1. **Cross-validation** — test model on different parts of data to check generalization (Kuhn & Johnson, 2019).  
2. **Regularization** — techniques like Ridge or Lasso reduce the effect of unimportant features (Kuhn & Johnson, 2019).  
3. **Simplify model or add more data** — use fewer features or collect more training data (James et al., 2021).

## 5. Real-World Case Studies

### Case Study 1 – Healthcare

**Title:** “Predicting Medical Expenses Using Multiple Linear Regression” (Sariyar et al., 2018)  

- **Goal:** Estimate medical costs for individuals to help insurance companies plan premiums.  
- **Data:** 1,338 patient records including age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region.  
- **Model:** Multiple Linear Regression  
- **Results:**  
  - R² ≈ 0.74, RMSE ≈ \$4,500  
  - Smoking, BMI, and age were strongest predictors  
  - Helped insurance companies predict costs more accurately  
- **Insight:** Shows how regression can guide planning and resource allocation in healthcare (Sariyar et al., 2018).

### Case Study 2 – Transportation

**Title:** “Predicting Taxi Trip Duration Using Multiple Linear Regression” (Journal of Big Data, 2021)  

- **Goal:** Estimate taxi ride duration in New York City based on distance, pickup time, and weather.  
- **Data:** 55,000 trips with distance, pickup hour, day of week, and weather.  
- **Model:** Multiple Linear Regression  
- **Results:**  
  - R² ≈ 0.76, RMSE ≈ 4.8 minutes  
  - Distance and pickup hour were strongest predictors  
  - Helped taxi companies plan trips better
