# Research Assignment: Introduction to Machine Learning

## 1. Definition of Machine Learning with a Real-Life Example

**Definition:**  
Machine Learning (ML) is a field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on designing systems capable of **identifying patterns in data and making predictions or decisions without explicit instructions**. Unlike conventional software, which follows rigid rules, ML algorithms adapt their behavior based on experience, improving over time as more data becomes available (Domingos, 2015; Alpaydin, 2020).

**Real-Life Example:**  
A prominent example is **predictive maintenance in manufacturing**. Industrial machines are equipped with sensors that continuously record operational data such as temperature, vibration, and pressure. An ML model analyzes historical sensor data to predict when a machine is likely to fail. This allows companies to schedule maintenance proactively, reducing downtime and operational costs. Unlike traditional methods that rely on fixed maintenance schedules, ML-based predictive maintenance adapts to the actual condition of each machine.

**Comparison Table: Traditional Approach vs Machine Learning Approach**

| Aspect                     | Traditional Approach                          | Machine Learning Approach                     |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Rule creation               | Based on fixed schedules or human expertise | Learned from sensor data patterns            |
| Adaptability                | Static, does not adapt to new conditions    | Adapts dynamically to new data              |
| Example                     | Replace machine parts every 3 months         | Predict machine failure using historical sensor data |

## 2. Supervised Learning vs Unsupervised Learning

**Supervised Learning:**  
- Uses **labeled data** (inputs X with known outputs y).  
- The model learns by comparing predictions to actual outcomes.  
- Tasks: **Regression** (predicting continuous values) and **Classification** (predicting categories).  
- **Example:** Predicting house prices based on features like size, location, and number of rooms. The model is trained on historical data with known prices.

**Unsupervised Learning:**  
- Uses **unlabeled data**; the model must find patterns or groupings.  
- Tasks: **Clustering** (group similar items) and **Dimensionality Reduction** (simplify complex data).  
- **Example:** Customer segmentation in marketing. Using purchase history and demographic data, the algorithm clusters customers into groups (frequent buyers, discount seekers, etc.) without predefined labels.

**Comparison Table: Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning**

| Aspect          | Supervised Learning         | Unsupervised Learning        |
|-----------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|
| Data type       | Labeled (X + y)            | Unlabeled (X only)           |
| Goal            | Learn mapping from input to output | Find hidden patterns in data |
| Common tasks    | Regression, Classification  | Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction |
| Example         | House price prediction      | Customer segmentation        |
| Algorithms      | Linear Regression, Decision Trees | K-Means, PCA               |

## 3. Overfitting: Causes and Prevention

**Definition:**  
Overfitting occurs when a model **memorizes the training data instead of learning general patterns**, leading to excellent performance on training data but poor results on new, unseen data (Goodfellow et al., 2016).

**Causes:**  
1. Excessive model complexity (e.g., deep trees, high-degree polynomials).  
2. Insufficient training data, causing the model to learn noise instead of patterns.  
3. Irrelevant or noisy features that confuse the model.

**Prevention Strategies:**  
- **Simplify the model:** Reduce parameters or use simpler algorithms.  
- **Regularization:** Apply L1/L2 penalties to avoid over-reliance on certain features.  
- **Cross-validation:** Validate model performance on multiple folds of the dataset.  
- **Collect more data:** Increases generalization capability.  
- **Early stopping:** Halt training before the model begins overfitting.

## 4. Training Data and Test Data Split

Machine learning models must be evaluated on **unseen data** to measure generalization accurately. Therefore, datasets are split:

- **Training data (70–80%)**: Used to train the model and learn patterns.  
- **Test data (20–30%)**: Used to evaluate performance on unseen data.

**Example:**  
A dataset of 1,000 house records could be split into 800 for training and 200 for testing. If the model performs well on both sets, it is generalizing effectively. If performance is high only on training data, overfitting is likely.

**Purpose of Splitting:**  
- Prevents misleading performance evaluation.  
- Ensures the model is tested on data it has never seen.  
- Optional: A validation set can be used for hyperparameter tuning.

**Title:** Predicting Diabetes Mellitus Using Machine Learning Techniques (Scientific Reports, 2020)

**Summary:**  
Researchers applied **supervised learning algorithms** to the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset, which includes patient health measurements such as BMI, glucose level, and blood pressure. The goal was to predict the likelihood of diabetes.

**Algorithms Tested:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines.  
**Best Result:** Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy (~80%).  
**Key Findings:** Features like glucose concentration and BMI were the most predictive indicators of diabetes risk.  

**Impact:**  
Machine learning aids healthcare professionals in **early identification of high-risk patients**, enabling preventive care and better treatment planning.
