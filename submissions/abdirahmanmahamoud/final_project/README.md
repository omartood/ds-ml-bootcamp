# Diabetes Prediction Project

The Diabetes Prediction Project estimates whether an individual is **Diabetic or Non-Diabetic** using health-related features, including pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, skin thickness, insulin level, BMI, diabetes pedigree function, and age. The project demonstrates how machine learning can analyze medical data to predict diabetes risk.
