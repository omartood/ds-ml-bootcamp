# 🏡 House Price Prediction: Machine Learning Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other relevant factors. The goal is to provide accurate price estimations to assist buyers, sellers, and investors in making informed decisions.

## 🧪 Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered a comprehensive dataset containing various features influencing house prices.  

2. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Handled missing values.  
   - Encoded categorical variables.  
   - Normalized numerical features.  

3. **Feature Selection**: Identified the most significant features affecting house prices.  

4. **Model Training**:  
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.  
   - Trained multiple models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and XGBoost.  

5. **Model Evaluation**:  
   - Assessed model performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.  
   - Selected the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.

## 🌐 Front-End Development

The front-end application allows users to input house features and obtain predicted prices. It is built using:

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered applications.  
- **TypeScript**: Adds static typing to JavaScript, improving code quality and maintainability.  
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
