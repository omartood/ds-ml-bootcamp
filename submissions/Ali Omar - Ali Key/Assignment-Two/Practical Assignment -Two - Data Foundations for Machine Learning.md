# Daily Transportation Costs of University Students in Mogadishu
> **Author: Ali Omar Abdi**  

## 1. Collection Method
This dataset was created by surveying **100 university students in Mogadishu** about their daily transportation habits. Each student answered questions about:
- **Age**
- **Distance** from home to university (in kilometers)
- **Mode of transport** (Bajaj, Bus, Walking, Taxi, Motorcycle)
- **Travel time** (in minutes)
- **Days per week** they attend classes
- **Daily cost of transport** (in USD)

Some cost data was verified by checking typical fares in the city.

**Sample (7 rows):**

| # | Age | Distance (km) | Mode of Transport | Travel Time (min) | Days/Week | Daily Cost (USD) |
|---|-----|---------------|------------------|------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| 1 | 28  | 1.3           | Walking          | 25               | 4         | 0.00            |
| 2 | 20  | 6.0           | Motorcycle       | 15               | 7         | 1.28            |
| 3 | 24  | 0.7           | Bajaj            | 23               | 4         | 1.07            |
| 4 | 26  | 5.0           | Motorcycle       | 22               | 7         | 1.20            |
| 5 | 24  | 2.2           | Motorcycle       | 27               | 3         | 0.98            |

## 4. Data Quality Issues

This dataset includes some real-world challenges:
- **Missing values:** Some students did not know their exact distance.
- **Mixed formats:** Distance sometimes reported in minutes instead of kilometers.
- **Spelling mistakes:** For example, “Baj” instead of “Bajaj.”
- **Imbalanced classes:** More students use Walking and Bajaj than Taxi.
- **Currency conversion:** Some costs were converted from Somali Shillings to USD.

These issues will be addressed in the data cleaning lesson.

## 5. Machine Learning Use Cases

This dataset can be used for:
- **Regression:** Predicting daily transport cost based on student features.
- **Classification:** Grouping students into Low, Medium, or High spenders.
- **Clustering:** Discovering patterns, such as “long-distance bus users” vs. “short-distance walkers.”

This information can help students, universities, and policymakers understand and improve transportation for students in Mogadishu.
