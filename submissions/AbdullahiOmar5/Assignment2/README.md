# This is a my assignment 2 dataset for a data science and machine learning bootcamp.

The dataset contains some missing values, inconsistencies in the 'EmployementStatus' column, and some outliers in the 'Age' column.
In lesson 3 we will focus on cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and removing outliers.
After cleaning, the dataset will be used for further analysis and modeling.
