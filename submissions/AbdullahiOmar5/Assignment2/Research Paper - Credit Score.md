**Credit Score Dataset for Machine Learning: Collection and Data Quality Challenges**

---

## üì• Collection Method

This dataset is a simulated collection, manually created based on realistic assumptions and knowledge of typical banking credit data. Rather than extracting data from actual banks or using existing repositories, the dataset was generated by conceptualizing plausible customer profiles including age, income, debt, loans, and employment status. The aim was to reflect real-world variability and patterns without depending on sensitive or proprietary data.

To support learning about real data challenges, intentional data quality issues were introduced, such as missing values, inconsistent categorical labels, and null entries. This approach mimics common data problems in financial datasets, providing a rich environment for practicing data cleaning, preprocessing, and machine learning modeling in credit scoring.

## üìå Description of Features & Label

### üîπ Features (Input Variables `X`):

- **Age**: Numeric count in years  
- **MonthlyIncome**: Monthly income in local currency (may contain missing/null values)  
- **CreditCardDebt**: Current credit card debt amount (some missing)  
- **NumberOfLoans**: Number of active loans  
- **EmploymentStatus**: Categorical; includes inconsistent spelling and capitalization (e.g., "Employed", "Self-Employed", "unemployed", or missing)

### üî∏ Label (Output Variable `y`):

- **CreditScore**: Numeric credit score (some missing or zero values representing unknown data)

## üßæ Dataset Structure

- **Rows**: 120  
- **Columns**: 6 (5 features + 1 label)

## üìã Sample Data (First 10 Rows)

| Age | MonthlyIncome | CreditCardDebt | NumberOfLoans | EmploymentStatus | CreditScore |
|-----|---------------|----------------|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| 80  | 5000          | 200            | 2              | Employed         | 700         |
| 45  | 100           | 500            | 1              | Self-employed    | 680         |
| 30  | 200           | 300            | 3              | *(missing)*      | 620         |
| 25  | 300           | 400            | 0              | employed         | *(missing)* |
| 50  | 300           | 500            | 2              | employed         | 710         |
| 2   | 300           | 100            | *(missing)*    | *(missing)*      | 0           |
| 90  | NAN           | 500            | 1              | Self-Employed    | 720         |
| *(missing)* | 100   | 100            | 1              | Employed         | 730         |
| 60  | 100           | 500            | 4              | Employed         | 640         |
| 40  | NAN           | 800            | 0              | *(missing)*      | 760         |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Data Quality Issues

- **Missing Values**: Found in MonthlyIncome, CreditCardDebt, CreditScore, and EmploymentStatus  
- **Inconsistencies**: EmploymentStatus has inconsistent spelling and capitalization  
- **Outliers**: Implausible entries (e.g., Age of 2 with 900 loans)  
- **Bias**: Class imbalance in EmploymentStatus  
- **Null Labels**: CreditScore missing or zero in some records

---

## üß† Use Cases in Machine Learning

- **Regression**: Predict continuous credit scores  
- **Classification**: Categorize credit risk (e.g., Good, Average, Bad)  
- **Data Cleaning Practice**: Handle missing values, fix typos, normalize categories, detect outliers

This dataset supports experimentation with robust machine learning workflows that reflect real-world data  that is incomplete and challenging.
