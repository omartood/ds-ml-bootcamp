1. Imputation: Why Median vs. Mode?
The script uses a different strategy for imputing missing values depending on the type of data.

Mode for Categorical/Discrete Features: The mode is the most frequent value in a dataset. It is the appropriate choice for imputing missing values in categorical features like Location, Accidents, and Doors. This is because these features represent distinct, non-numeric categories or counts, and the mode preserves the most common and representative value for that category. Using a mean or median on these columns would be nonsensical.

Median for Continuous Features: The median is the middle value of a dataset. It's used here for imputing missing values in continuous numerical features like Odometer_km and Year. The median is the preferred choice over the mean when the data might be skewed or contain outliers. Unlike the mean, the median is not influenced by extreme values, making it a robust measure that provides a more accurate central tendency for the majority of the data. For example, a single very high odometer reading wouldn't drastically skew the imputed value.

Based on the Python script you provided, here is a detailed explanation of the data preprocessing decisions.

2. Outlier Handling: Why IQR Capping?
The script uses Interquartile Range (IQR) capping to handle outliers in the Price and Odometer_km columns.

The IQR method is robust and widely used because it defines outliers based on the statistical distribution of the data itself, rather than assuming a normal distribution.

How it Works: The IQR is the range between the 25th percentile (Q1) and the 75th percentile (Q3) of the data. Outliers are typically defined as values that fall below a lower bound (Q1−1.5×IQR) or above an upper bound (Q3+1.5×IQR).

Why it's a Good Choice: Instead of simply removing the outlier data points—which could lead to a loss of valuable information and data points—capping replaces these extreme values with the calculated upper or lower bound. This approach helps to reduce the impact of outliers on the model's performance without discarding entire rows of data. It effectively "pulls in" the extreme values, making the feature distribution less skewed and more stable for training a machine learning model.

3. Feature Engineering: Which Features and Why?
The script engineers several new features to provide a machine learning model with more predictive power. The creation of these features is a critical step in preparing the data for modeling.

Engineered Feature	Derivation	Why it's Useful
CarAge	2024 - df['Year']	A car's age is often a better predictor of its value and condition than its model year alone. This feature directly represents how old the car is, which is a key factor in depreciation.
Km_per_year	df['Odometer_km'] / df['CarAge']	This feature represents the average distance the car travels annually. It's a more nuanced measure of a car's usage than the total odometer reading alone. It helps normalize the odometer value by considering the car's age, providing insight into whether the car was used heavily or sparingly over its lifetime.
Is_Urban	A binary flag based on one-hot encoded Location columns	This feature simplifies the Location variable into a single binary category. It creates a simple flag to distinguish between vehicles located in urban areas versus other types of locations, which could be a significant predictor of things like wear and tear or demand.
LogPrice	np.log1p(df['Price'])	This is a logarithmic transformation of the Price. The price of a car is often not normally distributed but is heavily skewed to the right (many low-priced cars, few very expensive ones). The logarithmic transformation helps to normalize this distribution, which can improve the performance of many linear machine learning models by satisfying their underlying assumptions about the data's distribution.
NewAccidents	A binary flag for whether a car has had one or more accidents (1 if x > 0 else 0)	While the original Accidents column gives a count, a simple binary feature can be a strong signal for a model. This feature simplifies the information, making it easy for the model to learn the negative impact of simply having had an accident, regardless of the exact number.
