# Clustering in Machine Learning

## 1. Introduction to Clustering

Clustering is a machine learning technique that groups similar data points together without using pre-labeled examples (Han et al., 2022).  
It is part of *unsupervised learning*, which means that the algorithm tries to find patterns or structure in the data on its own.

This is very different from *supervised learning* methods such as classification and regression (Tan et al., 2018).  
In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on data that already has a target label or value.  
For instance, a regression model might predict house prices based on features like size and location, while a classification model might predict whether an email is spam or not.

Clustering, by contrast, has no labels to guide it.  
Instead, the algorithm tries to group points that are similar to each other and separate them from points that are different.

- *Example of Clustering:* A music streaming app can group users based on listening habits, such as favorite genres and artists, to create personalized playlists.  
- *Example of Supervised Learning:* An insurance company might use regression to predict the cost of a claim based on the driver‚Äôs age, car type, and history.

## 2. Clustering Algorithms

Clustering can be done using different approaches.  
The most common algorithms are *K-Means, **Hierarchical Clustering, and **DBSCAN* (Aggarwal & Reddy, 2014).

### üîπ K-Means

*How it works:*  
K-Means divides the data into k clusters, where k is a number chosen by the user.  
It starts by picking random points as cluster centers (called centroids).  
Then it repeats two steps (Han et al., 2022):

1. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.  
2. Update the centroids by taking the average of all points in the cluster.  

This process continues until the centroids stop moving significantly.

*Use Case:*  
Marketers use K-Means for customer segmentation, grouping shoppers with similar behavior so they can run targeted campaigns.

*Advantages:*  
‚úÖ Simple, fast, and works well on large datasets.  

*Limitations:*  
   Requires choosing k before running.  
   Struggles with clusters of very different shapes or sizes.

### üîπ Hierarchical Clustering

*How it works:*  
This method creates a tree-like structure called a *dendrogram* (Kaufman & Rousseeuw, 2009).  
It starts by treating every point as its own cluster and then gradually merges the two closest clusters.  
This process repeats until all points are in a single cluster.

*Use Case:*  
Biologists use hierarchical clustering to group genes with similar expression patterns and study their relationships.

*Advantages:*  
‚úÖ No need to choose the number of clusters in advance.  
‚úÖ Dendrogram provides a clear visualization.

*Limitations:*  
   Can be slow for very large datasets.  
   Sensitive to noise and outliers.

### üîπ DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

*How it works:*  
DBSCAN groups together points that are packed closely (dense regions) and marks points in low-density areas as noise.  
It uses two parameters (McInnes et al., 2017):

- *Œµ (epsilon):* The maximum distance to look for neighbors.  
- *MinPts:* The minimum number of neighbors required to form a dense cluster.

*Use Case:*  
DBSCAN is widely used for anomaly detection, such as spotting unusual credit card transactions that don‚Äôt fit any normal spending pattern.

*Advantages:*  
‚úÖ Finds clusters of any shape.  
‚úÖ Ignores noise/outliers.  
‚úÖ No need to choose k.

*Limitations:*  
   Choosing the right Œµ and MinPts can be tricky.  
   Struggles with data that has very different densities.

## 3. Clustering Metrics

Since clustering has no labels, we need special metrics to judge how good the clustering is (Tan et al., 2018).

| *Metric*             | *What It Measures*                              | *Good Value Means*                       | *When Useful*                           |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| *Elbow Method*      | Total variance (WCSS) vs number of clusters (k). | The "elbow" point shows the best k.     | When using K-Means to pick k.          |
| *Silhouette Score*  | How well points fit in their cluster (range: -1 to 1). | +1 = well-separated, 0 = overlap.         | Comparing algorithms or cluster counts.  |
| *Davies‚ÄìBouldin Index* | Ratio of within-cluster to between-cluster distances. | Lower is better (0 = perfect).            | Comparing different clustering models.   |

## 4. Challenges in Clustering

Clustering is often harder than supervised learning because there is no ‚Äúcorrect answer‚Äù (Han et al., 2022).  
This makes it more of an exploration process.

*Choosing the Right Number of Clusters:*  
Algorithms like K-Means need k in advance, but it is not always obvious what the right number should be.  
Choosing too few clusters can hide real differences, while too many can create meaningless groups.

*Handling High-Dimensional Data:*  
When datasets have many features, distances between points become less meaningful (curse of dimensionality).  
This makes it harder for distance-based algorithms like K-Means to work well.

*Dealing with Noise and Outliers:*  
Outliers can distort results, especially for algorithms like K-Means that rely on averages.  
DBSCAN helps by labeling outliers as noise (McInnes et al., 2017).

## 5. Real-World Case Study: Social Network Analysis

Clustering is very useful in analyzing social networks.  
For example, researchers often use clustering to find *communities of users* within a social media platform.

- *Goal:* Identify groups of users who interact frequently with each other.  
- *Data:* Graph data showing users and their friendships.  
- *Model Used:* DBSCAN, because it works well on networks where some users are very connected and others are isolated.  
- *Results:*  
  - Groups of highly connected users (communities) were identified.  
  - The results can be used to recommend new friends, detect influential users, or find suspicious groups.
